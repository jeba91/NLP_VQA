VQA_image_features.h5 - contains the ResNet image features for all the images(train, val, test) as an array
VQA_img_features2id.json - contains the mapping from image_id to index in the .h5 file

WARNING: Always convert the loaded data from .h5 file to numpy array. This is done because if you are using multiple threads to read the data from .h5 file sometimes it picks up data from the incorrect index.

Sample Code to access the image features

import h5py
import json
import numpy as np

img_features = np.asarray(h5py.File(path_to_h5_file, 'r')['img_features'])

with open('path_to_json_file', 'r') as f:
     visual_feat_mapping = json.load(f)['VQA_imgid2id']

h5_id = visual_feat_mapping[str(img_id)]
img_feat = img_features[h5_id]
